## About this profile

This repository serves as a curated portfolio of my work across applied machine learning, LLM based systems, and data driven experimentation.

The projects highlighted below represent a mix of academic research, competitive modeling, and enterprise system development, with a strong focus on reproducibility, system design, and real world constraints.

---

## Core focus
- Applied Machine Learning and Predictive Modeling
- LLM applications, RAG pipelines, and AI assistants
- Data engineering and analytics workflows
- Experimental research translated into usable systems

## Projects completed at Spici srl

<img src="assets/spici.png" height="42" alt="Spici srl" />

The following systems were fully designed and implemented during my role as **Data Scientist at Spici srl**.  
These projects reached functional completion but were not released to production due to business or organizational constraints.

**Notes:**
- The **ArcGIS Map App** is currently **non functional**, as the backend database previously hosted on **AWS** has been removed.
- System design, data modeling, and application logic were fully completed during development.

**Work scope included:**
- End to end system design and data pipelines  
- Analytical and geospatial modeling  
- Dashboard and visualization layers  
- Prototyping for enterprise and public sector use cases
